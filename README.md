# BackPropagation_classification_model.repo
- A simple DL classification model for Backpropagation algo.
# What is BackPropagation ? :
- <a href = https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backpropagation-in-machine-learning/>BackPropagation</a> is the essence of neural net training.
- It is the practice of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate (i.e. loss) obtained in the previous epoch (i.e. iteration.) Proper tuning of the weights ensures lower error rates, making the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
# What are Classification algo's :
- Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data
